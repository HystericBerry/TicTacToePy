# TicTacToePy
A basic Tic Tac Toe game that can be invoked using "python main.py". Only parses int arrays.
This project was made to reinforce my basic python knowledge of list, class, function manipulation, etc.

# Syntax
1) invoke at command line using: python main.py
2) when prompted by "Enter x y separated by spaces: ", 2 integers separated by white space: x y
